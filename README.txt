Check neural_parser_task_description.pdf for more information about the method used and the possible arguments.

# 1. Create an environment with dependencies specified in local_env.yml (note that this can take some time depending on your laptop):
    
    conda env create -f local_env.yml

# 2. Activate the new environment:
    
    conda activate cs224n_a3


# To deactivate an active environment, use
